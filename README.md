# risk-catalogger

WIP; just for fun tool (for now) for viewing incident risks, risk factors and their relative ranking vs a reliability target. 

Ideally this should serve as a tool to capture past incidents, their ETT{D,R,F} and % of failures so as to enable core platform engineers to make informed reliability decisions, and ideally to improve their platform reliability score.

To run this in a terminal:
 
	make run

Some of the widgets are just placeholders for now. I may not use termui going forward but it's simple enough to start.
